# Project 1: Snake, Water, Gun Game 🐍💧🔫

A simple Python-based terminal game where the user plays against the computer.

## Rules

- **Water** douses **Gun** (Water wins)
- **Gun** kills **Snake** (Gun wins)

## Features
- Computer makes a random choice using the `random` library.
- User input is mapped using a Python dictionary.
- Includes basic error handling for invalid inputs.

## How to Play
1. Run `python main.py` in your terminal.
2. Enter 's' for Snake, 'w' for Water, or 'g' for Gun.
3. See if you can beat the computer!

## What I Learned
- Implementing game logic with `if-elif-else`.
- Using the `random` module for AI decision-making.
- Handling `KeyError` by validating user input.
